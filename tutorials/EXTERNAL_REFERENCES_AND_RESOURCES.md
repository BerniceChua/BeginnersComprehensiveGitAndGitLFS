# EXTERNAL REFERENCES & RESOURCES:
A lot of what I wrote in this guide are from my own experience using git version control.  But in the beginning, I also learned these from someone else or somewhere else (other people's blog posts, youtube tutorials, online courses, and of course from other people in person).  These are the sources.  Aside from that, I also use them to fact check myself.

For historical purposes, here is the old version of this tutorial:

</p>


## ABSTRACT / SUMMARY:
This is meant to be a comprehensive tutorial for absolute first-timers.  Most of the guides that I've seen out there require prior knowledge of coding.  This guide/walkthrough addresses that.  The target audience are either people who don’t have a programming or computer engineering background, or people who are beginners, or people who are not familiar with the command line.  Anyone who wishes to learn about version control can use this.  

This tutorial will guide through first-time setup, and the first time to access a project.  It also contains a glossary with short definitions, and also links to external resources.  (TO DO: how to initialize your own git repo.)
